Using MojoSetup.

If there are gaps in this documentation, please ask on the MojoSetup mailing

 and then questions can go to mojosetup@icculus.org. This document will
 be updated as we see what parts are confusing, so feedback is appreciated.


Putting together a MojoSetup installer involves four general steps:
1) Compile the software.
2) Set up the installer filesystem structure.
3) Write a config file.
4) Package up the final file for distribution.

Each step has a lot of details, but all installers basically follow those same
 basic development steps.


Compile the software:

You will need some tools. First, you'll need your platform's favorite build
 tools. You'll also need CMake (http://www.cmake.org/), and a Subversion
 (http://subversion.tigris.org/) client. These are all available for most
 popular operating systems, and some not-so-popular ones.

Get the latest version of MojoSetup from Subversion:

     svn svn://svn.icculus.org/mojosetup/trunk mojosetup


Then you'll need to point CMake at it:

     cd mojosetup
     ccmake .

Tweak the build settings to your liking. You'll want to set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
 to MinSizeRel, to make the compiled binary be as small as possible, and
 then trim out features you don't need. For example, you can drop the
 HTTP and FTP support to save about 25 kilobytes on the binary. You can also
 drop support for various archive types, pieces of Lua you don't plan to use,
 etc.

CMake will get you project files for whatever development environment you use
 (Makefiles, XCode, Visual Studio, etc). Build the project. You should end
 up with some shared libraries for whatever GUIs you left enabled, and
 a mojsetup binary. Strip the debug symbols and put these aside for later.

If you are building MojoSetup without the Lua parser, you'll want to build
 the separate Lua compiler (MOJOSETUP_BUILD_LUAC in ccmake). That will produce
 a "mojoluac" binary. Put that aside for later, too.


Set up the installer filesystem structure:

This is fairly easy. The installer eventually wants to see a directory
 tree like this:

    data/
    scripts/
    guis/

This is called the "base archive," even if it's a real directory tree in the
 physical filesystem and not in an actual archive, such as a .zip file.

"data" is where the installer looks for files included in the installer itself
 that need installation (as opposed to those being read from the network
 or a CD-ROM, etc). READMEs and EULAs go in here, too. The installer
 doesn't care how things under data/ are arranged.

"guis" is where the installer looks for those shared libraries that got
 built in the first step. Copy them in here, if you built any.

"scripts" is where Lua scripts go. You'll put your config file in here
 (config.lua), the translation table (localizations.lua), and whatever other
 scripts come with MojoSetup, which are required application logic. This
 directory can hold either .lua files (source code), or their .luac
 equivalents. If you built MojoSetup without the Lua parser to save space,
 you'll need to compile the .lua sources into .luac objects now, or the
 installer won't know what to do with them. It's safe to compile them even
 if you include the parser.

    cd scripts
    ../mojoluac -o config.luac config.lua
    cd ..

You can strip debug symbols from the compiled scripts to save more space,
 but you'll get less useful information if there's a script error:

    cd scripts
    ../mojoluac -s -o config.luac config.lua
    cd ..

Once you finish constructing this directory tree, put it aside for later.


Write a config file:

This is the complicated part, and where most of your effort will be spent.
 This document will try to cover all the provided facilities, but as the
 configuration file also provides a robust programming language, not only
 is the full scope beyond this document, you can also accomplish all sorts
 of things we haven't even considered yet.

Configuration files are Lua scripts. The Lua language and runtime library is
 documented at http://www.lua.org/, and they sell an excellent book called
 "Programming in Lua" which is a fast read and will demonstrate all manners
 of wild and interesting features of the language. That being said, most
 people rolling config files don't need any significant Lua expertise, and
 basic config files don't need any programming experience at all.

The config file is named config.lua, and it must be a text file in UTF-8
 encoding.

Configuration files are a hierarchy of elements that take this form:

 Setup.DataType
 {
     someattribute = value1,
     someotherattribute = value2,
 }

Elements can nest:

 Setup.DataType
 {
     someattribute = value1,
     someotherattribute = value2,
     Setup.AnotherDataType
     {
         something = value3,
     }
 }


Here are the elements, and the attributes they can possess.

 There are some specifiers by the attributes:
  mustExist: Error if is nil (usually if you don't specify it). The other
             "mustBe" descriptions consider nil to be valid when mustExist
             isn't explicitly mentioned.
  no default: This attribute will not have a default if not specified.
  default X: This attribute defaults to X if not specified.
  mustBeString: Error if isn't a string.
  cantBeEmpty: Error is this string is "". String can be nil, though.
  mustBeBool: Error if isn't true, false, or nil.
  mustBeFunction: Error if isn't a function (can be C or Lua).
  mustBeNumber: Error if isn't a number.
  mustBeUrl: Error if isn't a string that matches the regexp "^.+://.-/.*".
  mustBeStringOrTableOfStrings: Error if isn't a string or an array of strings.

 Attributes that aren't explicitly specified take on their default value. In
  cases without a default, they are effectively set to Lua's "nil" value.
  This makes boolean values be treated as "false." Plan accordingly.


 Setup.Package:

  All configurations need at least one Setup.Package element. Everything other
  element is added under Setup.Package. One full run of the installer is
  done for each Setup.Package. You can have multiple packages in one file, and
  the installer will run through for each one as if the program was started
  multiple times. If there are multiple packages and an installation failure
  occurs, all successfully-installed packages will remain. In most cases, you
  only want one Setup.Package and should use Setup.Option to cull pieces
  of the package.

  Setup.Package attributes:

   id (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This is a unique identifier for your package. Currently it is used as
    the base of the install path, but future features may use it for other
    things. Set this to something short, unique, and human-readable, like
    "mygame".


   disabled (no default, mustBeBool)

    If this is true, the entire package will be skipped by the installer. You
    probably want this to be true, but you might need to programmatically shut
    off a whole package.


   description (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This is your product's name. This will be displayed in the title bar, and
    other locations during installation.


   version (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This is the version of this package. This is arbitrary, and doesn't matter
    to the installer what you specify. It's usually a value like "1.0" or
    "beta3"

    The installer may use this for future features, like upgrading previous
    installations.


   destination (no default, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This attribute can be used to force the installation into a specific
    location in the physical filesystem. Unless you are building something
    very specific (like device drivers for a well-defined platform), you
    probably should not use this attribute. If destination isn't forced,
    the installer will prompt the user for the destination, possibly
    recommmending locations to her.


   recommended_destinations (no default, mustBeStringOrTableOfStrings)

    This attribute lets you define some favorable places to install the
    package. You can have a table of strings or a single string:

        recommended_destinations = MojoSetup.info.homedir,
            ...or...
        recommended_destinations = { "/usr/local/games", "/opt/games" },

    These strings are presented in the UI to the user when selecting a
    install destination, but they can override them with their own choice.
    The "id" attribute is appended to these before displaying to the end
    user, so they'll see, for example, "/usr/local/games/mygame" and
    "/opt/games/mygame" ... if a listed directory is determined to be
    unwritable to the user (lack of permissions), it will be removed from the
    list before presentation to the user.


   precheck (no default, mustBeFunction)

    If this attribute is defined, it is called by the installer after the
    configuration is parsed and the GUI has started, but before the user has
    interacted with the installer at all. It passes the finalized
    Setup.Package table as a parameter.


   preflight (no default, mustBeFunction)

    If this attribute is defined, it is called by the installer after the
    user has chosen options to install. The heavy-lifting of the installer
    is about to begin: downloading files and installing the Package. It
    passes the finalized Setup.Package table as a parameter.


   preinstall (no default, mustBeFunction)

    If this attribute is defined, it is called by the installer after all
    needed external files are downloaded and installation of files is about
    to begin. It passes the finalized Setup.Package table as a parameter.


   postinstall (no default, mustBeFunction)

    If this attribute is defined, it is called by the installer after the
    entire package was successfully installed to disk. It passes the finalized
    Setup.Package table as a parameter.


   splash (no default, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.


   url (no default, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.


   once (default true, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.


   category (default "Games", mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.


   promptoverwrite (default true, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.
    Please refer to Setup.File.allowoverwrite for now.


   binarypath (no default, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.


   update_url (no default, mustBeString, mustBeUrl)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.


   superuser (default false, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME) This attribute is for future expansion.


 Setup.Readme:

  This element is a child of Setup.Package. It can be used to display a
  information about the package to the end user, such as a welcome message,
  FAQs, or other orientation information. There can be multiple Setup.Readme
  elements listed, in which case the end user will be shown each readme
  individually before installation may proceed. The readmes are shown first
  before any other interaction occurs.

  Setup.Readme attributes:

   description (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This is a brief description of the Readme, used for title bars and such.


   source (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This is a filename in the base archive's "data" directory that contains
    the readme text. Currently this must be a text file in UTF-8 encoding.


 Setup.Eula:

  This element is a child of Setup.Package. It can be used to display a
  license agreement to the end user, which they must agree to before
  installation can proceed. If they refuse the license, the installer
  terminates without installing anything. There can be multiple Setup.Eula
  elements listed, in which case the end user will be asked to agree to
  each license individually before installation may proceed. The licenses are
  shown after any readme elements.

  Setup.Eula attributes:

   description (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This is a brief description of the license, used for title bars and such.


   source (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    This is a filename in the base archive's "data" directory that contains
    the license text. Currently this must be a text file in UTF-8 encoding.



 Setup.Media:

  This element is required if you need to install data from removable media,
  such as a DVD-ROM drive. The installer needs a means to identify the
  media as the correct source when it is connected to the system.

  Setup.Media attributes:

   id (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   description (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   uniquefile (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)




 Setup.File:

  (!!! FIXME write me.)

  Setup.File attributes:

   source (no default, mustBeUrl)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   destination (no default, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   wildcards (no default, mustBeStringOrTableOfStrings)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   filter (no default, mustBeFunction)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   allowoverwrite (no default, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)



 Setup.Option:

  (!!! FIXME write me.)

  Setup.Option attributes:

   value (default false, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   required (default false, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   disabled (default false, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   bytes (no default, mustExist, mustBeNumber)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   description (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)




 Setup.OptionGroup:

  (!!! FIXME write me.)

  Setup.OptionGroup attributes:

   disabled (no default, mustBeBool)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)


   description (no default, mustExist, mustBeString, cantBeEmpty)

    (!!! FIXME write me.)




Package up the final file for distribution:

Now you have a MojoSetup binary and a directory tree containing your data, GUI
 plugins, and scripts (including the config.lua you just wrote). Now you just
 need to glue them together. MojoSetup will attempt to look at itself as an
 archive on startup, which works in the same way "self-extracting" exe files
 worked on other operating systems. If you want MojoSetup to be
 self-extracting, zip your directory tree up and append it to the binary:

     zip -9r mydata.zip data guis scripts
     cat mydata.zip >> mojosetup

Now rename "mojosetup" to something meaningful (mygame-1.0-linux-x86.bin or
 whatever), and you've got an installer.

If you have the luxury of a real filesystem (inside a disk image or on a CD
 you are shipping, for example), MojoSetup will use the binary's directory
 if it doesn't find a zipfile appended to the binary itself, so you can just
 have "data", "scripts" and "guis" in the same directory as "mojosetup" to
 have it work, too.


Now you're done! Give your installer to the public.



Extra credit:

Localization:

If you added strings to the installer or your config file that you want
 translated at runtime, you need to add them to localization.lua. This is
 a Lua script, too, of course, but you really should treat it like a basic
 config file.

Don't remove strings that are already in the file...MojoSetup uses these
 internally. Just add your own strings.

The format looks something like this:

    ["Yes"] = {
        es = "Si";
        fr = "Oui";
    };


As you can see, the ["Yes"] is a string to translate. These are always English
 by convention, but this is whatever the string you wish to translate. Please
 note that the brackets are important, and only used on this specific string.

The fields in this structure are language abbreviations that match a user's
 locale and the string of translated text.

Please note that you can do locale-specific translations, too:

    ["colors"] = {
        en_UK = "colours";
    };

All strings in this file (and all Lua scripts) are UTF-8 encoded. Using a
 high-ASCII character will not work like you expect at runtime!

These lookup tables are used at runtime to translate strings, both by you and
 internally by MojoSetup. You can do a translation by calling:

    MojoSetup.translate("colors")

We recommend making a convenience function like this at the top of your
 config.lua...

    local function _ = MojoSetup.translate

...so that you have a convention for translations that cause minimal clutter:

    Setup.Option {
        description = _("Level editor utility"),
        -- ...etc...
    }
