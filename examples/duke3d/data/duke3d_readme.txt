What is this?

This is icculus.org's port of Duke Nukem 3D.

The included installer can use the PC retail version of the game (the
"Atomic Edition"). If you don't have a retail disc, the installer can
also install the shareware data files, which leaves you with only
episode one, and various other shareware nagging.

Retail discs can be found on eBay or in bargain bins for dirt cheap.
3DRealms actually did a new print run of discs in 2003 or so, and as of
this writing, sells them from their online store at

    http://www.3drealms.com/

Duke3D is not "Abandonware"...please do not pirate the game! There are
several legitimate channels to obtain a copy of the retail version.

We do not provide support for this version of Duke3D, nor will 3DRealms.
We accept bug reports here...

...but don't promise to ever act on them. If it breaks, you get to keep
both shiny pieces.

The editor is not necessarily obvious to use, but basically works like
the DOS version, so you can get the old school manual off the Internet.

Networking is included, but is flakey, so we're not documenting it
here. Google might turn up some info for the brave.
