This is MojoSetup, a new installer application.

This is a work in progress, so if you download this same installer later,
 it may look radically different, or work better or worse.

We are using this Duke3D installation as an initial testbed for MojoSetup.

Please report bugs and irritations in this installer to Ryan:

     icculus@icculus.org


All suggestions are welcome.

Please make sure you have the latest copy of this installer:

     http://icculus.org/mojosetup/example/duke3d/


Please note that bug reports about Duke Nukem 3D are also welcome, but this
 isn't an officially supported build. Don't expect game fixes from either
 Ryan or 3DRealms for this build. Source code to Duke3D is here:

     http://icculus.org/duke3d/


There is still a lot to be done with MojoSetup. Check back often!

Enjoy,
--ryan.
